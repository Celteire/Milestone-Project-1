Milestone Project 1 - Author : Niall Hobson : Created 23/08/2018

Project Name : Monkees Fan Page

This project is all about providing a nostalgic feel good website for the many Monkees fans that grew up ennjoying
their saturday morning crazy romps on television and listening to their numerous hits, including many top ten's and
four number ones.

Although it is not meant to be an exhaustive collection of everything the Monkees did or said which would be for the 
die-hard fans. It is meant to provide a flavour of the Monkees and remind the casual visitor of some happy moments. 
This site also is meant to provide details on what is going on with the Monkees today via the 'blog' and 'hire me' 
sections and also provide links to the super detailed fan sites acccessed through the social links like facebook, 
twitter and youtube.

The four best known songs are linked to a carousel of four pictures new and old of the band. Some of the album covers
are displayed and when clicked on expand, click off they collapse.

In designing this project, I wanted to provide a platform for the user which I envisage will initially want to listen
to the hits !, and then click on the albums before either looking back up to the navigation bar for more information
webpages that appear on the same page or else move down to the footer section where they can subscribe to an email mailing
list for a newsletter and/or choose to open a social media tab to get further information.

The ideas are to provide a user with a hub to get a taster of the 'best of The Monkees' and also to allow the user to get
further details of what is happening now with the Monkees, tours, dates gossip, this can be done through the navigation bar
for internal to the site details and the footer to go to external sources.

Using Mockplus to create a template of how the main page and links would look, the mockplus template is in the project files
and called 'Mockplus Project' this file can be opened in the mockplus program. The file is the wireframe subdirectory.

I established from the template the look and feel of the site, where I wanted to put things and the flow.

Starting at the header, the user can see a navigation bar, which allows the user to choose to 

Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea
Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
